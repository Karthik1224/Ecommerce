# Ecommerce
This is a JavaFX program that implements a basic e-commerce user interface. 
The UI consists of a login page, a header bar, a footer bar, and a body section. 
The createContent method creates a BorderPane layout and adds the header bar, body, and footer bar to it.
The application allows customers to log in, search for products, add products to the cart, and place orders for the items in the cart. 
It also displays the customer's orders and provides a sign-out functionality.
